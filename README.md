1. Template
This directory serves as a basic template for programs. It includes a directory structure and Makefile for building, as well as a batch file for building.
2. Linked-lists
This directory serves as a place for linked list related programs. This will include creating linked lists, traversing them, reversing them and probably some heap and stack exercises.
3. Arrays
This directory contains some actions based on arrays. the Scramble project takes 2 arrays, fills them up and then randomizes their content using rand(). I've inserted a bubblesort and qsort as well for fun.
4. Binary search
This directory servers as a palce for binary search implementations. It's one I kind of like to do from time to time. It just a basic version that checks for values in arrays of integers.

## Leetcode

1. patches-661
