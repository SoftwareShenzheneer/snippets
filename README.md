# snippets
A collection of small code snippets to stay busy coding

1. Template
This directory serves as a basic template for programs. It includes a directory structure and Makefile for building, as well as a batch file for building.
2. Linked-lists
This directory serves as a place for linked list related programs. This will include creating linked lists, traversing them, reversing them and probably some heap and stack exercises.
3. Arrays
This directory contains some actions based on arrays. the Scramble project takes 2 arrays, fills them up and then randomizes their content using rand(). I've inserted a bubblesort and qsort as well for fun.
4. Binary search
This directory servers as a palce for binary search implementations. It's one I kind of like to do from time to time. It just a basic version that checks for values in arrays of integers.
5. Crystal balls
Project to display a search algorithm that uses an inherently different step than for example a binary search. More practice than practical ofcourse but it's fun.
7. Merge sorted
Merge 2 sorted arrays using 2 pointers principle for a more optimized method. Added some testcases to the mix.
8. Partition problem
During a course I looked into, there was a mention of the partition problem. Essentially it's a decrease and conquer method of dividing the sum of an array into 2 subsets of equal value when possible.

## Leetcode
A collection of leetcode questions solved or worked on.

1. patches-661
Maximum number of patches required to reach an integer n from an array. Problem 661.
